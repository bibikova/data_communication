The datasets which have been explored are flights dataset for years 1990, 2008 and dataset which was created solely for the cancelled flights out of 22 datasets for the period of years 1987 to 2008.

Initial datasets we downloaded from http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html.

Datasets contains information about date of flights which is represented in few separate columns (day of the week, day of the month, month), scheduled and actual departure and arrival time, delay time and cause of the delay, destination and origin of the flight, carriers information as well as cancelled flights.
